# DAO Creative Universe
The DAO Creative Universe is a map of the DAO ecosystem, featuring you. It's comprised of a set of freely-shared physical and digital illustrations of the DAO ecosystem. It's also an experiment in decentralized branding supported by DAOstar, a (nonprofit, public good) standards body for DAOs.

## The opportunity
Help us map, illustrate, and communicate the DAO ecosystem, including its values, projects, ideas, stories, myths, and people.

^ kinda like this, but even cooler

## Getting started
1. Find us at ETH Denver and check out the physical map (we're building one in Miro and will share that soon).
2. Ping us if you have any ideas for how we could do it better. Seriously, we are mostly devs & researchers, so even the most basic artistic / marketing / branding advice would be useful.
3. Join the [the DAOstar Discord](https://discord.gg/crEUNHEr68) and say hi in the `#creative-universe` channel.

## Assets
All the content in the DAO Creative Universe (i.e. everything in this folder EXCEPT for the 'logos' folder) is free for you to use. We also have a several physical assets, including a bunch of medallions, a star map, a big banner, and a couple of mobile printers. Tell us what to do with them!
